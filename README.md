# react-from-scratch
This is a bash script for starting a basic react-app from "scratch" using npm
You can run this script and it will create a folder containing all the files 
necessary to start a react app.
```
./react-scratch.sh
```sh 
After that you just run, on the folder `./my-app`, `npm run start`
And your app should be running on local http://localhost:8080/
